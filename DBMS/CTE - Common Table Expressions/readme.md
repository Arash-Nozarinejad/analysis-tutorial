# CTE Mastery: A complete beginner to advanced common table expressions Tutorial

Learn the power of Common Table Expressions (CTE) in SQL and take your skills to the next level. In this tutorial, you'll discover how CTE can simplify your queries, improve readability and boost performance. From basic to advanced, we'll cover everything you need to know about this essential tool for working with data in MySQL.

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to the complete beginner to advanced common table expressions tutorial. Whether it is your first time reading on common table expressions or you have used them before but want to unlock the complete potential common table expressions offer this tutorial is for you.

This tutorial is designed to first introduce to basic concept on common table expressions and gradually teach you more advanced concept along the way.

## 1) Common Table Expressions: Basic CTE Concepts

A common table expression (CTE) is a named temporary result set that exists within the scope of a single statement and that can be referenced to later within that statement, possibly multiple times.

In SQL, every statement or query produces a temporary result or relation. A CTE is used to name those temporary result sets that exist the execution scope of that particular statement, such as CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
Similar to a derived table, a CTE is not stored as an object and lasts only during the execution of a query. But unlike a derived table, a CTE can be self-referencing -Also called a recursive CTE, but more on that later.

CTEs are usually used to replace complex subqueries in order to make them more readable.

## 3) Common Table Expressions CTE Syntax

To specify common table expressions, use a WITH clause that has one or more comma-separated subclauses. Each subclause provides a subquery that produces a result set, and associates a name with the subquery.

```MySQL
WITH
    cte_name  [(col_name, col_name, ...)] AS (sub_query),
    cte_name  [(col_name, col_name, ...)] AS (sub_query),

```

Example:

```MySQL
WITH
    cte1 AS (SELECT a, b FROM table1),
    cte2 AS (SELECT c, d FROM table2)
SELECT b, d FROM cte1 JOIN cte2
WHERE cte1.a = cte2.c;

```

In this example, two CTEs, Cte1 and Cte2, are defined using SELECT statements that select columns from two different tables, table1 and table2.

The SELECT statement outside of the CTEs then uses JOIN to combine the results of the two CTEs, selecting the b column from Cte1 and the d column from Cte2. The WHERE clause specifies that the results should only include rows where the a column from Cte1 matches the c column from Cte2.

This example shows how CTEs can be used to break down complex SQL queries into smaller, more manageable pieces. The CTEs act as temporary tables that can be used to simplify the main query, making it easier to write and understand.
