Spreadsheets are an integral part of any analysis task. Although they are easy to learn they offer a huge plethora of benefits and help analysts immensely.

The two most common spreadsheet programs are:

* Microsoft Excel
* Google Sheets

These two programs are basically the same and learning either one is enough for analysis, and the skills and functionalities you've learned are transferable.
